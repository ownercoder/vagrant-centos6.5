# puppet-nginx

## Overview

Install, enable and configure an NGINX web server instance with its main
configuration file options as well as additional configuration snippets.

The module is very Red Hat Enterprise Linux focused, as the defaults try to
change everything in ways which are typical for RHEL, but it also works on
other distributions and is very easy to port if needed.

* `nginx` : Main class for the NGINX web server.
* `nginx::file` : Manage additional configuration snippets.
* `nginx::params` : Class to set distribution specific defaults.

## Examples

Default server, with a typical minimal virtualhost and ready for PHP-FPM :

    include nginx
    nginx::file { 'www.example.com.conf':
      content => template('mymodule/www.example.com.conf.erb'),
    }
    # Use the included example FastCGI for PHP configuration
    nginx::file { 'php.conf.inc':
      source => 'puppet:///modules/nginx/php.conf.inc',
    }

Sample configuration file `mymodule/www.example.com.conf.erb` mentioned above :

    # Fix for "upstream sent too big header ..." errors
    fastcgi_buffers 8 8k;
    fastcgi_buffer_size 8k;
    upstream fpmbackend {
      server unix:/var/run/php-fpm-www.sock;
    }
    # Main virtualhost
    server {
      listen 80;
      server_name www.example.com;
      root /var/www/www.example.com;
      include /etc/nginx/conf.d/php.conf.inc;
      access_log /var/log/nginx/www.example.com-access.log main;
      error_log /var/log/nginx/www.example.com-error.log;
    }

If you intend to use a PHP framework where all non-existing requests must be
handled by `/index.php`, then also install and include `php-to-index.conf.inc`.
